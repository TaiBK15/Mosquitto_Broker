				*****
1.Update the signing key for apt-get
To use the new repository you should first import the repository
package signing key follow the below comman, the wget command is 
used to download single file and stores in a current directory.
Command:
  >>sudo wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-repo.gpg.key

2.add this key to apt-get
  >>sudo apt-key add mosquitto-repo.gpg.key

3.To add the repository, first go to the folder containing the repository 
lists for apt-get:
  >>cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/

4.Download the repository list file for Mosquitto:
Before downloading, we can check OS that Raspberry pi is running (Wheezy, Jessie, Stretch)
  >>cat /etc/os-release
Download:
  >>sudo wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-stretch.list

5.Update:
  >>sudo apt-get update
if not success, try this previous:
  >>sudo apt-get upgrade

6.Install Mosquitto
  >>sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients

7.Prevent remote broker from publishing loop back to local broker (config MQTT bridge)
Go to file config MQTT bridge: /etc/mosquitto/conf.fd/mainserver.conf
Set "try_private true"
Because that indicates to the remote broker that it is a bridge not an
normal client. That means remote broker not to publish back to local broker.
