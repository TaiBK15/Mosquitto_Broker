1. Local broker
- PUBLISH:
   >>mosquitto_pub -m "message mqtt" -t "test" -u "local_broker" -P "123456"
- SUBSCRIBE
   >>mosquitto_sub -v -t "test" -u "local_broker" -P "123456" 

2. Remote broker
- PUBLISH:
   >>mosquitto_pub -h "###.cloudmqtt.com" -p "#####" -t "remote_broker" -u "#####" -P "######" -m "hello"
- SUBSCRIBE:
   >>mosquitto_sub -h "###.cloudmqtt.com" -p "#####" -t "End_node1/temp/pub" -u "######" -P "#######"

3. Run mosquitto broker local
Type on terminal:
   >>mosquitto
- To watch log on processing mosquitto
   >>mosquitto -v
If only using "mosquitto", it will run default config that means
running file default.conf

4. Running other config file
   >>mosquitto -c /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/cloudmqtt.conf -v 
//to watch log

5.Create Username, Password for MQTT broker:
   >>sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd 'username'
-Then type password into terminal
-Pointing to default config file:
   >>sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/default.conf
-Copy and paste:
   allow_anonymous false
   password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd

*******************************************************************
STATUS:
- Create successfully MQTT bridge between local broker (Mosquitto broker)
and remote broker (CloudMQTT). 
- Once send message from cloudmqtt into Mosquitto broker, It will publish automatically
that message with the same topic to Mqtt client subscribing local broker.
- Transfer bi-direction successfully but when local client publish message, client subscribe message display twice! Because Mosquitto broker receives message and publish CloudMQTT, CloudMQTT publish that message back Mosquitto broker.

NOTE:
1/ In file .conf:
local_clientid indicates for remote broker - CloudMQTT
remote_clientid indicate for local broker - Mosquitto broker

2/When start system and run command 'mosquitto', then getting "Error: address already in use".
The reason that there are process running mosquitto before that means Mosquitto Broker is running. Perhaps because of file /etc/init.d/mosquitto, this file will start mosquitto automatically when system already boot up, run mosquitto.conf that means 2 file default.conf and cloudmqtt.conf. Therefor, when system boots up, we can use MQTT bridge.
- To watch the process running Mosquitto:
   >>ps -aux | grep mosqui*
- To stop Mosquitto broker running and close port listenning:
   >>sudo systemctl stop mosquitto
or:
   >>sudo /etc/init.d/mosquitto stop
